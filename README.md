# Tarkov Items
Hey, thanks for installing my plugin <3

All of the scripts use models taken from Illusion's Escape from Tarkov megapack addon on the Steam workshop below, so be sure to add that to your content:

Otherwise, feel free to use this plugin as you wish, examples being filler for a script spawner, resources and ingredients in a crafting system, or to add more food and drink to the pool. It will hopefully save you a lot of time spent tediously creating each individual item x

With that said, the crafting plugin written by Wowm0d and the survival/needs system by ZeMysicalTaco are perfect fits I can recommend should you need some more inspiration.

If you need any support or further guidance, or wish to offer suggestions, feel free to speak to me on Discord:
